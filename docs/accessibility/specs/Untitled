How can we update the audit implementation specialist agent here in this project to make sure that it properly moves? It reads the proper locations for accessibility and SEO audits. Then, when it works on the specs, it always goes into pending first, works on them in order, and moves them into completed after it's done. Both for the SEO ones and the accessibility ones follow the same pattern.
