Most portfolio sites show projects as "done" or "not done."

That's a lie. Projects live on a spectrum.

This week I shipped a 6-phase lifecycle system for my portfolio: Concept → Design → Architecture → Building → Deployed → Iterating. Every project now shows exactly where it stands.

My ISS tracker? Iterating. That AI orchestration tool I keep mentioning? Still in Architecture. The honesty is uncomfortable, but that's the point.

Here's what else shipped:

→ A writing-style skill that captures my voice, so Claude Code can draft content consistently without me starting from scratch every time

→ Accessibility fixes for 12 WCAG violations (skip navigation, focus management, reduced motion support)

→ Automation that generates LinkedIn post drafts when I merge PRs

That last one is meta. I'm using AI to write about what I build with AI.

But here's the thing: the skill doesn't replace my voice. It encodes it. Four of my best posts, annotated with what makes them work. Now Claude has a reference instead of guessing.

Building in public means showing the messy middle. The phases that aren't "Deployed" yet. The systems that help you talk about your work without it becoming a full-time job.

What signals do you look for when evaluating someone's side projects?
