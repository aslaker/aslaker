Most portfolio sites show projects as "done" or "not done."

But that framing misses something. Projects live on a spectrum.

Last week I shared my rebuilt portfolio, and the response surprised me. So I'm continuing to build in public. Here's what shipped this week.

🔧 **A 6-phase lifecycle system.**

Concept → Design → Architecture → Building → Deployed → Iterating.

Every project now shows exactly where it stands. My ISS tracker? Iterating. That AI orchestration tool I keep mentioning? Still in Architecture.

The honesty is uncomfortable. That's the point.

📦 **What else shipped:**

→ A writing-style skill that captures my voice, so Claude Code can draft content without me starting from scratch every time

→ Accessibility fixes for 12 WCAG violations (skip navigation, focus management, reduced motion support). Someone pointed out issues in my last post. They were right.

→ Automation that generates LinkedIn post drafts when I merge PRs

That last one is meta. I'm using AI to write about what I build with AI.

But the skill doesn't replace my voice. It encodes it. Four of my best posts, annotated with what makes them work. Now Claude has a reference instead of guessing.

🎯 **Why this matters:**

Building in public means showing the messy middle. The phases that aren't "Deployed" yet. The systems that help you talk about your work without it becoming a full-time job.

What signals do you look for when evaluating someone's side projects? And if you're building in public too, what's one thing you shipped recently that you're proud of?
