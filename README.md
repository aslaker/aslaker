### Hi! I'm Adam and I'm a Full Stack Developer

#### Currently working on 🚧
- An AI powered recipe application that sends me and my wife recipe options for meals based on our ingredients
- A way to generate video content for LinkedIn and Youtube leveraging multiple different AI models

#### Currently Learning 🌱
- ~~Rust (Might be at this one a while)~~
- ~~How to leverage Rust to build smart contracts on the Solana blockchain~~
- Paused on Rust, decided to learn Go instead
- Cutting my teeth on the new NextJS v14 serverless component structure
- Building CMS systems leveraging PayloadCMS
- How to be a better leader/manager within the engineering world, as well as how to better support my managers (shout out to Sarah Drasner for this wonderful book [Engineering Management for the Rest of Us](https://www.engmanagement.dev/)

#### I'm looking to collaborate on 🤝
Almost anything!  I specialize in Full stack Typescript right now, and my current favorite tech stack is NextJS v15, TailwindCSS, Prisma, and tRPC.

#### Ask me about 🤔
- My board game collection, and how my wife is such a lovely accommodating woman in this regard
- My love of single track mountain biking
- The fact that I was a competition dancer for 7 years when I was younger
