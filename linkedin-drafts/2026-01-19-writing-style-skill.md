# LinkedIn Post Draft

**PR:** #11 - feat: add writing-style skill for consistent voice

Ever notice how AI-generated content sounds like AI-generated content?

I just shipped a writing-style skill that teaches Claude how I actually write.

Here's the thing: most people treat AI like a content vending machine. Prompt goes in, generic post comes out. But if you're going to use AI for drafting, it should sound like you, not like every other AI-written post on LinkedIn.

So I built a skill that captures my voice. Calm, firm, blunt, funny. Strong opinions, weakly held. Every piece has to ship something concrete (a framework, a checklist, actual code). No corporate speak, no "excited to announce," no vague improvement claims.

The interesting part? I included four annotated samples from my actual posts. Each one breaks down what works and why. Opening hooks, pivot points, where the humor lands, how to close with a genuine question instead of a performative CTA.

Now when I run `/linkedin-post` to draft content about a PR, Claude reads the style guide and samples first. It's not trying to guess my voice. It's applying patterns from posts I actually shipped.

This is the difference between "AI wrote this" and "AI helped me write this faster."

The skill auto-triggers when Claude detects content drafting. No extra prompts needed. Just consistent voice across everything I ship.

What's your signal for when AI-generated content doesn't sound human?
