I installed a personal AI assistant on my home server last weekend.

The verdict? Squarely in the middle. Actually, closer to amazing than the middle.

Look up Clawdbot on YouTube (now called Moltbot after Anthropic asked them to change the name). I set it up, named my agents after favorite characters, and now I have:

→ Eddie Dean (Dark Tower) as my executive assistant
→ Tron as my security analyst
→ Sazed (Mistborn) as my research assistant

Here's what made it actually fun instead of a security nightmare: I didn't just plug it into everything. I'm building the system incrementally, checking security at every step.

The workflow I've landed on:

Every day at 9 PM, Eddie asks what my to-dos will be tomorrow while suggesting items based on our conversations. At 11 PM, Tron runs security analytics across my system. By 9:30 AM, I get a digest: to-dos, security alerts, and 2-3 random notes from my Obsidian vault with reflection questions.

All research and notes auto-sync to Obsidian, tagged and categorized.

The biggest lesson from this project? Infrastructure and security is still hard. AI doesn't magically handle that for you. If you're vibe coding or building projects like this, don't assume everything will be taken care of.

Take security seriously from day one. Use these projects as learning experiences. The struggle teaches you more than the smooth path ever will.

What's your experience with self-hosted AI tools? Are you running anything locally?
