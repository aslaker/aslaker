Most people run AI assistants in the cloud. I'm running mine on a home server in my basement.

I just added Personal Assistant to my portfolio: a self-hosted AI system running on a Zimaboard (basically a mini PC gathering dust that I finally put to use).

The interesting part: it's not just one assistant. Using Moltbot, I'm orchestrating multiple specialized agents that each own different problem domains. Executive assistant for scheduling and email triage. Security agent for monitoring logs. Research agent for deep dives. Project-specific agents that come and go based on what I'm building.

But here's the real value: this setup forces me to learn things I've been putting off. Linux administration isn't optional when you're the sysadmin. Secure remote access via Tailscale isn't just "nice to have" when you need to reach your home network. Server management becomes visceral when your AI assistant stops responding because you forgot to set up log rotation.

It's productivity automation wrapped in a home lab disguised as a side project.

What's one automation you wish you had, but haven't built yet?
