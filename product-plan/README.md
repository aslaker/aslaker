# adamslaker.dev — Design Handoff

This folder contains everything needed to implement adamslaker.dev — a personal site with a dark, terminal-inspired, Matrix aesthetic.

## What's Included

**Ready-to-Use Prompts:**
- `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md` — Prompt template for full implementation
- `prompts/section-prompt.md` — Prompt template for section-by-section implementation

**Instructions:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary (provide with every implementation)
- `instructions/one-shot-instructions.md` — All milestones combined for full implementation
- `instructions/incremental/` — 7 milestone instructions (foundation + 6 sections)

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, design tokens
- `data-model/` — Core entity types and sample data
- `shell/` — Application shell components (header, nav, social links)
- `sections/` — 6 section component packages with test instructions

## How to Use This

### Option A: Incremental (Recommended)

Build your app milestone by milestone for better control:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your implementation codebase
2. Start with Foundation (`instructions/incremental/01-foundation.md`) — includes design tokens, data model, routing, and application shell
3. For each section:
   - Open `prompts/section-prompt.md`
   - Fill in the section variables at the top (SECTION_NAME, SECTION_ID, NN)
   - Copy/paste into your coding agent
   - Answer questions and implement
4. Review and test after each milestone

### Option B: One-Shot

Build the entire app in one session:

1. Copy the `product-plan/` folder to your implementation codebase
2. Open `prompts/one-shot-prompt.md`
3. Add any additional notes to the prompt
4. Copy/paste the prompt into your coding agent
5. Answer the agent's clarifying questions
6. Let the agent plan and implement everything

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions. For best results:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green

The test instructions are **framework-agnostic** — they describe WHAT to test, not HOW. Adapt to your testing setup (Jest, Vitest, Playwright, Cypress, etc.).

## Section Overview

| Section | Description | Key Components |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Hero | Landing with typing animation | Hero, TypingText |
| Projects | Card grid with detail modals | ProjectsGrid, ProjectCard, ProjectModal |
| About | Themed interest cards | CharacterSheetCard, ScorecardCard, TrailMapCard |
| Consulting | Service offerings | ConsultingSection, ServiceCard |
| Contact | Multi-step contact modal | ContactSection, ContactModal |
| Blog | Searchable blog | BlogList, BlogPostCard, BlogDetail |

## Tips

- **Use the pre-written prompts** — They include important clarifying questions about tech stack and integrations
- **Add your own notes** — Customize prompts with project-specific context when needed
- **Build incrementally** — The incremental approach helps catch issues early
- **Review thoroughly** — Check implementations against the provided screenshots and test instructions
