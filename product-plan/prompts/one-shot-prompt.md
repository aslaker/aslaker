# One-Shot Implementation Prompt

I need you to implement a complete personal website based on detailed design specifications and UI components I'm providing.

## Instructions

Please carefully read and analyze the following files:

1. **@product-plan/product-overview.md** — Product summary with sections and data model overview
2. **@product-plan/instructions/one-shot-instructions.md** — Complete implementation instructions for all milestones

After reading these, also review:
- **@product-plan/design-system/** — Color and typography tokens
- **@product-plan/data-model/** — Entity types and relationships
- **@product-plan/shell/** — Application shell components
- **@product-plan/sections/** — All section components, types, sample data, and test instructions

## Before You Begin

Please ask me clarifying questions about:

1. **Tech Stack Preferences**
   - What framework should I use? (Next.js, Remix, Astro, etc.)
   - Any specific hosting/deployment requirements? (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
   - Do you want a CMS for content management?

2. **Content Management**
   - Should blog posts be stored in markdown files, a headless CMS, or a database?
   - How should project data be managed? (Static JSON, CMS, etc.)

3. **Contact Form Backend**
   - What service should handle form submissions? (HubSpot, Formspree, custom API?)
   - What calendar service for booking? (Calendly, Cal.com, Google Calendar?)

4. **Analytics & Integrations**
   - Any analytics requirements? (Plausible, Google Analytics, etc.)
   - Other third-party integrations needed?

5. **Domain & SEO**
   - What's the domain? (adamslaker.dev)
   - Any specific SEO requirements or meta tags needed?

6. **Any Other Clarifications**
   - Questions about specific features or user flows
   - Edge cases that need clarification

Lastly, be sure to ask me if I have any other notes to add for this implementation.

Once I answer your questions, create a comprehensive implementation plan before coding.
